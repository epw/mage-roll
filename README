This project isolates the functional code from the Google Wave
"mage-roll" bot, for use in other programs.

To install, download the sources and from the mage-roll directory run:
   $ sudo python setup.py install

You can then use the module by running a Python shell and typing:
    >>> import mage_roll
    >>> mage_roll.parse_roll ("3 diff 6")

The parse_roll function takes a string formatted as a number of dice,
and optionally the word "diff" or a / followed by the difficulty. It
outputs a string indicating the input it is acting on, the results of
the dice rolled, and the number of successes calculated if a
difficulty is given.

parse_roll (param, prefix="", count_rerolled_ones=False)
	   => "[" + prefix + param + "]: " + rolls [+ " Successes: " + successes
	      [+ " BOTCH!"]]

param - The string to interpret specifying how many dice to roll and
      the difficulty.
prefix - A string to put near the beginning of the returned output.
count_rerolled_ones - Whether an exploding ten followed by a one
      cancel each other out.

The roll() function can also be used directly:

roll (dice, difficulty=6, count_rerolled_ones=False, output=False)
     => (successes, rolls)

Simulate rolling dice using revised old/classic World of Darkness rules.
Ones subtract successes, and tens explode. Ones but no successes causes a
botch.

dice - Size of dice pool (number of dice being rolled)
difficulty - Minimum value counted as a success [default 6]
count_rerolled_ones - Whether ones on rerolls from tens should subtract
    successes [default False]
output - Whether to print results to stdout [default False]
